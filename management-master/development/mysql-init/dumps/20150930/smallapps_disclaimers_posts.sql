Please also note that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are in addition to any other agreements that govern your use of products, services, content, tools, and information available from the Service. This Agreement applies to all users of the Service (in each case, a \"User\").</p>\n<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, without any obligation and without any notice requirement, to change, improve or correct the information, materials and descriptions available on this Site and disseminated by Dealflow.</p>\n<p>We may suspend and/or deny access to the Service for any reason at any time.

While some information on the Site may be publicly available, much of the Service is limited to individuals and institutions that qualify as “accredited investors” as defined by Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933. Accordingly, Users are required to complete a questionnaire to determine whether or not they are “accredited investors”. Dealflow relies entirely on representations made by such Users and while we reserve the right to perform background checks and other information verification steps in order to confirm the veracity of any User\'s responses to the questionnaire, we are under no obligation to do so. Therefore Dealflow does not represent that any User is an “accredited investor”. Dealflow may require Users to recertify their “accredited investor” status from time to time. Dealflow may change eligibility criteria for the Service at any time, without notice. This provision is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Service is revoked in any such jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Representations by User</em></strong></p>\n<p>By using the Service, you represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to form a binding contract, and that all information you submit is accurate and truthful and not misleading.

Dealflow may, at its sole discretion, revoke access to or refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity at any time for any reason.
