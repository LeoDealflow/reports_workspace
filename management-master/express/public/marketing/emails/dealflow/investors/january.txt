Hi {{{first_name}}},

Thanks for signing up to the Dealflow.com webcast on Jan 13. We’re getting a great response and we estimate 400+ people will sign up.

If you’re interested in learning about investing in Dealflow.com (as opposed to just learning about the product), let me know as I’m setting up individual calls for this. I’m encouraging anyone who’s interested specifically in the investment opportunity to connect with me prior to the webcast.

Thanks again and let me know your availability later this week if you’d like to discuss.

Best,
Steven
