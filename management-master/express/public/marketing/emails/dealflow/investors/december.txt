Hi {{{first_name}}},

Just wanted to make sure you received the email I sent last week on Dealflow.com.

Let me know if you’d be interested in more information or in doing a phone call to discuss.

Best,
Steven

Subject: Dealflow launch, capital raise, etc.

Periodically I review the list of our members and I noticed you’re subscribed to our venture newsletter. We released our beta last week and I’m reaching out to you because we’re doing a capital raise for Dealflow and I thought given your background this might be a fit.

Before we launched we began to sign up customers and since launch we’re getting great traction. Now that we’re live at www.dealflow.com we’re looking to finish our $2 million raise. I’d be interested in discussing this with you if you felt it’s a good fit.

Let me know if you’re open to do a quick call. Thanks in advance and thanks for using Dealflow!

Best Regards,
--
