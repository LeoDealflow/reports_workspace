<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">Hi {{{first_name}}},</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">Since you signed up for last week’s webcast, I wanted to quickly reach out to you.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">As Dealflow.com wraps up our final week raising capital, (if you’d like to participate at the present valuation, you need to let us know before Jan 31), I wanted to give you a few pointers on how to get the most out of the website.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">If you’re raising capital…</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">- Claim or post your deal!  This is the only way investors will find you.<br />
- Keep your deal up-to-date. The more often you update your deal, the higher your Signal score (which helps investors quickly find you in Search).<br />
- Reach out to us with questions by using live chat, email, or you can call us at (516) 876-8006.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">If you’re looking to invest in companies…</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">- Track interesting deals, so you’re kept up-to-date as soon as those deals are updated with new information.<br />
- Create Saved Searches with your specific search parameters, so you can easily filter by the types of companies interesting to you.<br />
- Fill out your Preferences. We use this information behind-the-scenes to make sure you’re getting the best dealflow possible.</p>
