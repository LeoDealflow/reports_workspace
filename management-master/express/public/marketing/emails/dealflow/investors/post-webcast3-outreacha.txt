{{{first_name}}},

I’m just following up on last week’s webcast. We had a great turnout with 577 people registered. Since the call, another 150 have registered for the archive of the webcast. So we’re pleased that people love what we’re doing.

As I mentioned on the webcast, we’re wrapping up our seed round of investment at what we feel is a very low valuation. All indications of interest need to be in by Jan 31 (end of next week).

If you have an interest in participating in this round, or if you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email.

Best,
Steven
