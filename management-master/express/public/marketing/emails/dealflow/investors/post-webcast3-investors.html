<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">Hi {{{first_name}}},</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">I’m just following up on the webcast we did last week. We had a great turnout with 577 people registered.  Since the call, another 166 have viewed the archive of the webcast.  So we’re pleased that people love what we’re doing.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">I was just looking through the list and I noticed that you didn't sign into the live presentation and wanted to let you know that you can still view the webcast here: <a href="http://webcast.dealflow.com" target="_blank">http://webcast.dealflow.com</a></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">We’re wrapping up our present round at what we feel is a very low valuation. I’m gathering all indications of interest by Jan 31. So if you'd like to own a piece of Dealflow, or if you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email.<br />
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">Best regards,<br>Steven</p><br />
