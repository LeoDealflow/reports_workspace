Hi {{{first_name}}},

Since you signed up for last week’s webcast, I wanted to quickly reach out to you.

As Dealflow.com wraps up our final week raising capital, (if you’d like to participate at the present valuation, you need to let us know before Jan 31), I wanted to give you a few pointers on how to get the most out of the website.

If you’re raising capital…

- Claim or post your deal! This is the only way investors will find you.
- Keep your deal up-to-date. The more often you update your deal, the higher your Signal score (which helps investors quickly find you in Search).
- Reach out to us with questions by using live chat, email, or you can call us at (516) 876-8006.

If you’re looking to invest in companies…

- Track interesting deals, so you’re kept up-to-date as soon as those deals are updated with new information.
- Create Saved Searches with your specific search parameters, so you can easily filter by the types of companies interesting to you.
- Fill out your Preferences. We use this information behind-the-scenes to make sure you’re getting the best dealflow possible.

Let us know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Steven
