Hi {{{first_name}}},

I’m just following up on the webcast we did last week. We had a great turnout with 577 people registered. Since the call, another 166 have viewed the archive of the webcast. So we’re pleased that people love what we’re doing.

I was just looking through the list and I noticed that you didn't sign into the live presentation and wanted to let you know that you can still view the webcast here: http://webcast.dealflow.com

We’re wrapping up our present round at what we feel is a very low valuation. I’m gathering all indications of interest by Jan 31. So if you'd like to own a piece of Dealflow, or if you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email.
Best regards,
Steven
