[First Name],

Thank you for registering for the Normal webcast scheduled for tomorrow.  In addition to discussing the product and the company, Normal’s CEO, Nikki Kaufman, has some very exciting potential news developing that is not quite ready to be announced.  As a result, tomorrow’s webcast is being postponed until September.   We will send you an email with the new date and time as soon as it becomes available.

In the interim, Nikki will be reaching out to you to schedule a time to chat or meet in person regarding Normal.

Thanks,

The Dealflow Team
