In addition to discussing the product and the company, Normal’s CEO, Nikki Kaufman, has some very exciting potential news developing that is not quite ready to be announced.  As a result, tomorrow’s webcast is being postponed until September.   We will send you an email with the new date and time as soon as it becomes available.</p>
                                        <p>In the interim, Nikki will be reaching out to you to schedule a time to chat or meet in person regarding Normal.<br /><br />
                                        Thanks,<br /><br />
