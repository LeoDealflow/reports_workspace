The 86 Co.
Raising: $1,500,000
Sector: Consumer Staples

The 86 Co. is a spirits company that focuses on the wants and needs of bartenders. The company spent time interviewing over 180 different bartenders to find out what they really want in a brand – from the packaging to the design of the bottles to the taste of the spirits.
“The bartender profession is exploding, and we believe nobody has managed to properly capitalize on it,” said The 86 Co. co-founder and CEO Malte Barnekow. “Bartending is becoming a career, and there is nothing out there for their profession.”
The company launched in 2012 with four products: Fords Gin, Cana Brava Rum, Aylesbury Duck Vodka and Tequila Cabeza. Barnekow noted that they weren’t just tested for individual taste, but for how the spirits taste as mixed drinks.
Every spirit comes in an ergonomic bottle that is designed with a strong neck, smooth surface, middle grip and deflecting shoulders. The opening can fit a speed-pour, and the base is designed to fit easily in the well.   
“We are looking at a $3 million to $4 million run rate in sales right now,” said Barnekow. “Our products are in 23 states, Europe and we have a presence in Hong Kong, Australia and Canada.”
The 86 Co. has seen a 7.5% compounded growth rate since launch, and 95% of its market is on premises, or in bars and restaurants, where, according to the company, most alcohol consumption takes place. 
The company is raising an equity round, which will be used for inventory and new hires. 
“We started off raising $1 million, but we have more than half raised already,” said Barnekow. “As of last month we will be raising an additional $500,000 for a total of $1.5 million.”
Barnekow has spent eight years with Absolute Vodka, holding various positions including regional director for Latin America and marketing director for the U.S. Jason Kosmas, co-founder of The 86 Co., is a co-owner of Employees Only and Macao Trading Co., located in New York City.
