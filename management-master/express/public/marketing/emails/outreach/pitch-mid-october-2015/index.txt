Hi [First Name],
 
I’m reaching out to you after running across your profile in Dealflow.com, which we’re aiming to launch publicly in early November.  I noticed that you previously signed up to use our deal platform so I thought I’d reach out to you to see if you’d be interested in taking a look at the convertible debt offering we’re opening up to some of our investor members.
 
There has been some terrific news in this space over the past couple of weeks which I’ve been covering on my blog.  Including the announcement on the AngelList/CSC investment for $400 million: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/angellist-dead-long-live-steven-dresner?trk=pulse_spock-articles
 
Also, we’ve started building our product for the middle market the leveraged loan space.   This recent announcement from Fifth Street (Ticker FSAM) “MMKT Raises $5.9MM and Launches Platform to Transform the Middle Market Loan Syndication Process”, confirms our belief that this space is ripe for disruption. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/mmkt-raises-5-9mm-launches-120000957.html  (Note that MMKT raised the money at a $100MM valuation cap.)
 
We think this is all exciting news and two more examples confirming our thesis that institutional capital will pour into online deal markets. 
 
Let me know if you’d like to consider making an investment with us.  We have already closed on over $200K of our current $750K convertible offering and have another $250K circled.  In order to get this done quickly we are using a valuation cap of $10M.  The investors want us to close on the remaining $500K in a single closing so I’m working hard to make it happen in the next few weeks. Let me know if you’d like to participate and thanks for signing up to be a member of Dealflow.com when we go live.
 
Best,
Steven
