    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">Hi [First Name],</p>
    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">I’m reaching out to you after running across your profile in Dealflow.com, which we’re aiming to launch publicly in early November. I noticed that you previously signed up to use our deal platform so I thought I’d reach out to you to see if you’d be interested in taking a look at the convertible debt offering we’re opening up to some of our investor members.</p>
    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">There has been some terrific news in this space over the past couple of weeks which I’ve been covering on my blog.  Including the announcement on the AngelList/CSC investment for $400 million: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/angellist-dead-long-live-steven-dresner">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/angellist-dead-long-live-steven-dresner</a></a>
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">Also, we’ve started building our product for the middle market the leveraged loan space.   This recent announcement from Fifth Street (Ticker FSAM) “MMKT Raises $5.9MM and Launches Platform to Transform the Middle Market Loan Syndication Process”, confirms our belief that this space is ripe for disruption. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/mmkt-raises-5-9mm-launches-120000957.html  (Note that MMKT raised the money at a $100MM valuation cap.)</p>
    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">We think this is all exciting news and two more examples confirming our thesis that institutional capital will pour into online deal markets.<p>
    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">Let me know if you’d like to consider making an investment with us.  We have already closed on over $200K of our current $750K convertible offering and have another $250K circled.  In order to get this done quickly we are using a valuation cap of $10M.  The investors want us to close on the remaining $500K in a single closing so I’m working hard to make it happen in the next few weeks. Let me know if you’d like to participate and thanks for signing up to be a member of Dealflow.com when we go live.</p>
    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">Best,
        <br>Steven</p>
