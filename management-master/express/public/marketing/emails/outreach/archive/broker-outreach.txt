Thanks for signing up to Dealflow.com.  We're working on lots of new features to help you find private placement deals (we're now tracking over 50 new deals per day) and we're also working on ways you can find investors for your own current deals.
 
One of the things we've been developing are dedicated "Broker Pages" for firms like yours that pitch private placement deals to investors. The page would be similar to an eBay Store for your firm -- geared specifically to market your deals to investors who use our website. This wouldn't be a generic website marketing platform. It would be designed to help you make targeted outreach to a new audience of investors for your deals among the thousands of registered users signed up to use Dealflow.com. If you had a private placement you were selling, you would post the deal on your dedicated company webpage at Dealflow.com and investors would then be able to find it.  If they express interest in the deal you would receive their contact details. You could also use your Broker Page to market your services to potential new clients such as companies looking to raise capital with an intermediary.
 
Would having a Broker Page be something of interest to you?
 
Looking forward to your reply,
Steven
