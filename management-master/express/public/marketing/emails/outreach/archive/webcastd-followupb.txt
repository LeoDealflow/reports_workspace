I’m following up with you on last week’s webcast. We had a great turnout and the feedback since we launched the website is excellent.

As I mentioned on the webcast, we’re wrapping up our current round of investment.

If you have an interest in participating in this round, or if you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email.

Best, 
Steven
