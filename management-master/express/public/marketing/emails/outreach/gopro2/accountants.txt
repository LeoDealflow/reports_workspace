Dealflow.co Go Pro

I’m following up on the voicemail I left for you. We just released a new registration process on Dealflow.com that asks companies if they need an accountant who can assist with accounting services during their capital raise. The response from companies has been very good – many of them are asking for referrals to accountants. As a member of our Dealflow Pro Network you would receive these referrals.

We’re limiting the number of accounting firms who can join the Dealflow Pro Network so let me know if you would like to set up a call before all the spots are filled.

Yes, I want to learn more about the Dealflow Pro Network (http://dealflow.com/gopro-getinfo/?result={{{email_address}}}:Accountant).

If you have any questions or would like to leave us additional comments, please respond directly, or give us a call at (516) 876-8006
