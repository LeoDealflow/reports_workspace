Hi [First Name],

Thanks for participating in yesterday’s webinar for the Dealflow.com product launch. We had an amazing turnout and we’re getting lots of activity on the platform right out of the gate.

We had a number of requests for the sign up form to become a Premium Member and so here is a link to the form: ( http://dealflow.com/dealflow.com_website_access_and_use_agreement.pdf ).

We also put the archive of the webcast up, so if you’d like to view the webinar again, you can do it by clicking here: http://marketing.dealflow.com/dealflow-webcast-november-2015

If you have any questions you can reach out to me (steven@dealflow.com) or to Kevin Hartmann (kevin@dealflow.com) by either phone or email.

Regards, 
Steven
