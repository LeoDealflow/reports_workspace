Investment Opportunity: Brixco, Inc. to Open Fifteen New Locations

Brixco is offering Convertible Preferred Shares to expand its Brix and Grane brands into fifteen new locations, two first-to-market concepts that recreate the consumers’ experience of wine and spirits retailing.

Two Brix and one Grane location have been placed in operation in Omaha, Nebraska.  With revenues currently exceeding $6 million, Brix has built a platform to expand its innovative concepts into fifteen new locations in larger, upscale, urban markets throughout the US. 

Brixco is in the early stages of creating two distinct, high-potential chains that capitalize on the four strongest growth trends in the alcoholic beverage category: premium wines, craft beers, premium whiskeys, and craft cocktails. 

Brix combines three complimentary businesses under one roof – a wine, beer, and spirits retail store with a bistro and event center. Grane caters to the growing affinity for whiskeys and craft cocktails with the modern, small-portion whiskey dispensing/sampling technology, the first-of-its-kind in the United States. Overall growth in US premium whiskey consumption has grown by 75% since 2002, and 18% in the last three years.
