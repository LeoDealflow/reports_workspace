In honor of the new year, I'd like to give you the gift of Dealflow. On Tuesday, January 13th at 2:00pm (ET) I'll be hosting a private webcast, where I'd like to give you a tour of Dealflow, and demonstrate how you can get value out of the product that we've spent 2 years building.

We're revolutionizing the way deals are pitched. Our aim is to be the starting point for every investor looking to find and track new deals.

In this webcast, you’ll learn about a whole new way to find and track investment opportunities that interest you. You’ll also see how online deal marketing is working for companies raising capital today.

This interactive presentation will include some of the same team that worked with me at DealFlow Media prior to our selling that company to TheStreet.com. We’ll be discussing how our new software works, along with our performance metrics and our potential for growth. Join us on January 13 to find out how you can invest in Dealflow.com and have a meaningful stake in the future of deal marketing.
