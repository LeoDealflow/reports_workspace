Thanks for signing up recently. Dealflow.com launched not too long ago, and we're already the largest deal portal for investors. I'd like to take some time to show you what we've built. Tomorrow, January 13, at 2 PM (EST), I'll be hosting a private webcast, where I'll demonstrate how you can get unlimited value out of the financial deals database that we've spent 2 years developing for you.

We're revolutionizing the way deals are pitched. Our aim is to be the starting point for every investor looking to find and track new investment deals.

In this webcast, you’ll learn about a whole new way to find and track investment opportunities that interest you. You’ll also see how online deal marketing is working for companies raising capital today.

This interactive presentation will include some of the same team that worked with me at DealFlow Media prior to our selling of that company to TheStreet.com. We’ll be discussing how our new software works, along with our performance metrics and our potential for growth. Join us on January 13 to learn about this exciting area of deal-making and to find out how you can invest in Dealflow.com and have a meaningful stake in the future of deal marketing.
