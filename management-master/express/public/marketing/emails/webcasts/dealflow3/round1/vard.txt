You may have heard we recently launched Dealflow.com. For the past two years, we’ve been hard at work building a database of private placement offerings being pitched to investors. Today, we’re providing access to this database -- for free.

Dealflow is hosting a private webcast to discuss our Series A investment opportunity on Tuesday, January 13th at 2:00pm (ET)

We are using our own software to identify investors. I’ll be hosting a webcast on January 13 to discuss the launch of Dealflow, and articulate how we're revolutionizing the way deals are pitched.

Our aim is to be the starting point for every investor looking to find and track new deals. To do this, we need capital.

As more people sign up and use Dealflow, we’ve got the makings of a new distribution channel to find deals. Whether those deals are public, private, operating companies, or investment funds, we plan to replicate our strategy across every investment class where we deploy our data collection process.

In this webcast, you’ll learn about a whole new way to find and track investment opportunities that interest you. You’ll also see how online deal marketing is working for companies raising capital today.

This interactive presentation will include some of the same team that worked with me at DealFlow Media prior to our selling that company to TheStreet.com. We’ll be discussing how our new software works, along with our performance metrics and our potential for growth.

Join us on January 13 to find out how you can invest in Dealflow.com and have a meaningful stake in the future of deal marketing.
