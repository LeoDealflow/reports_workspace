Hi [First Name],

I wanted to thank you for your application to join Dealflow.com. We’ve been hard at work building Dealflow.com into the largest channel for online capital formation, and just last week we won the #1 prize at Amazon.com’s AWS pitch event in New York City.

There are now thousands of companies raising capital on Dealflow.com and over 9,000 investors who’ve asked to become members. If you’d like to be part of the private beta, you can login (https://app.dealflow.com/d/login/login.html), and then click on https://dealflow.com/accredited to fill out the application. We review each application and will reach out to you with any questions.

I’d also like to invite you to a live webcast on September 24 at 2pm, where I’ll discuss how you can invest in Dealflow.com. To join us (free), you can register at this link: http://marketing.dealflow.com/dealflow-webcast-september-2015/
. I’ll talk about new features we’re developing as well as where we’re headed in 2016.

Best regards,
Steven
