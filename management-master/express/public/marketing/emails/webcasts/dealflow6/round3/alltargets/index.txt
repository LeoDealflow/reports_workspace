Our Coverage Universe
---------------------
We compile information on companies engaged in actively-marketed fundraises and are not deemed to be a startup or angel-stage investment. Our data operations team scours the Internet, combs through social networks and regulatory filings, and taps into the deal communities we serve. If there’s a deal being marketed that falls in our research scope, we aim to know about it so our clients know about it.
