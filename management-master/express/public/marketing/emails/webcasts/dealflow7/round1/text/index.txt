Hi [First Name],

For the past two years I’ve been building an online deal platform that offers a new way to find and pitch investment opportunities. With thousands of deals listed on the website and over 9,000 people registered I think we’re well on our way.

It's clear that the move toward online capital formation is very real. Companies are borrowing online, raising equity online, and increasingly pitching their transactions on deal portals, social networks, and through email. If you’re not paying attention to this trend, you’ll be left behind.

I’m hosting a 30-minute webcast on Tuesday November 17 at 2pm ET to launch Dealflow.com and show you how to use it to find your next deal, your next investor, or your next client. I hope you’ll join me as we show you the future of deal marketing.

You can register at this link: http://marketing.dealflow.com/dealflow-webcast-november-2015

As always, call or email me if you’ve got questions.

Best regards,
Steven
