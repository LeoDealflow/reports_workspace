Hi Michael,

The Team here at Dealflow has spent the last year incorporating feedback, adding features, and refining Dealflow.com. On November 17, we’ll be taking Dealflow.com out of beta and we wanted you to be one of the first to have a look at the new product. Whether you’re an investor looking for opportunities, a company raising capital, or you are looking for new clients, we’re confident that you’ll get value from Dealflow.

You can check out the new product by joining us for a 30 minute webcast on November 17.  You can register by clicking here ( http://marketing.dealflow.com/dealflow-webcast-november-2015 ).

As part of our product launch we’ll be giving all eligible members free Premium access for 30 days.

Thanks for taking the time to check out what we are building here at Dealflow.

Regards,
