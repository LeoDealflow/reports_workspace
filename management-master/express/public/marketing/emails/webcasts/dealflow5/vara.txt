I’m hosting a webcast on February 24, to discuss the massive change in how people are discovering new deals using online marketing techniques.

In this webcast, you’ll learn how you can use Dealflow.com as a handy tool to improve your own “deal flow” and make finding new opportunities easy.

Browse “live” deals - We collect active deals from many sources. You get an easy way of sorting through those deals based on information we’ve gathered for you.

Filter deals that matter - We use a “signal” score to rank opportunities based on your own unique preferences. You can filter deals based on criteria which are customized for you.

Track and share deals - Whether you want to “save for later” or share an opportunity with a colleague, we make it easy to stay on top of deals that are important to you.
