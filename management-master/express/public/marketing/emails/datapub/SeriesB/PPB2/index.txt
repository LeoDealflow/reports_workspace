Reading between the lines of Citizen.vc’s “quasi” no-action letter

Last week’s blog covered Citizen.vc’s recent no-action letter.  As several readers pointed out, what was conspicuously absent from the SEC’s reply to Citizen.vc’s request for no-action was the absence of actual “no-action” language that’s customary in communications like this. In other words, there’s a lack of no-action in the no-action letter.

For example, in the Lamp Technologies letter which I referenced last week, the SEC included the following:

“On this basis, we would not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action under Section 7 of the Investment Company Act if Lamp posts information concerning private funds on the web site in the manner described in the Original Letter.”

I went to a couple more recent SEC letters which folks in the private placement industry routinely reference and rely on – AngelList and FundersClub. Sure enough, similar wording appears.

So the question is, what does the Citizen.vc letter mean exactly? I’m not a lawyer (note the disclaimer here) but as I see it, and as it relates to what Citizen.vc asked for, it appears the SEC doesn’t want to bless any objective process for how a deal portal should develop a “substantive pre-existing relationship.”  Rather the SEC is saying that this determination is subjective, based on the facts and circumstances of each relationship between a deal portal and investor.  So while it seems like the SEC thinks Citizen.vc’s process is fine, it wouldn’t bless the outcome of the process -- that is, whether Citizen.vc had developed a substantive relationship with each investor.

Stated simply, Citizen.vc could get the information they needed from their investor registration process, but they could still blow their analysis.  The SEC’s letter could’ve used a finer point I think.  But in any case, when the letter is paired with the CD&I’s there’s still some pretty decent guidance there. I suppose it’s better than nothing.

The other issue that readers pointed out was that in last week’s blog I covered only half the issue brought up by Citizen.vc –  how to avoid accidental general solicitation.  My partner Mike Bertisch (who actually is a lawyer) said that the more interesting thing here is that the SEC is signaling that they’re very much aware of all the “traditional” private placements being conducted on reliance under Rule 506(b), yet many of these traditional-style deals are being pitched using online portals, email solicitations, and some very non-traditional means that are likely general solicitations in the eyes of the SEC.

Mike points out that the SEC’s letter is a wakeup call that Rule 506(b) is as he put it, “A morass of shaky lines and potential second guessing whereas 506(c) is quite clear.”

Did you present at a pitch event?  Did you use an online portal?  Is your company listed on AngelList?  If you’ve done any of these things, it’s possible you conducted a general solicitation, even if you didn’t intend to do so.

It certainly seems like broader adoption of Rule 506(c) is inevitable as the relevance of online capital formation extends far beyond startup-promoting websites. Even if an issuer doesn’t want to have a public facing deal on a busy website, why not run the deal the “traditional way” but check the 506(c) box and simply collect some accredited verification letters?

I got word of all the Citizen.vc activity when I was in Tel Aviv, meeting with Mor Assia, the sharp 33 year old founder of Israel-based iAngels.  When our conversation turned to how everyone in the industry wants to see faster -- and let’s be honest, more liberal -- regulatory action, Mor seemed a lot more optimistic than yours truly. I told her, “When the Tinder generation is in power, we’ll see faster progress. In the meantime, let’s just be thankful for whatever guidance we get.”
