What does online dating have to do with online investing?

There’s been a lot of talk about Match.com in light of last Friday’s IPO filing for Match Group, the IAC-owned company that’s going public. So I thought it was only appropriate to write something on the subject.

I should probably start with an admission: I’m a recovering Match-a-holic.

When I was dating, I was legitimately addicted to Match.com.  And although it surprises a lot of people when I tell them this, I generally found that the women I met on Match were “as advertised.”  Meaning when I met them in person on a first date, they were more-or-less who I thought they would be.  From my own personal experience, I found Match to be valuable and a lot of fun too.

Something I used to do to on Match was update my personal profile often in order to figure out how to get maximum engagement with my intended audience.  I routinely did things like Photoshopping my kids out of a vacation picture or changing my job description from “software entrepreneur” to “hedge fund guy.” (Predictably, this last tweak resulted in a huge increase in interest.)

But nothing generated more attention than what I called my “Top 10 List.” On this list, I included snippets of what I thought women should know about me before they sent me an email.  I made sure it was informative (I’m not a Facebook user, I’m not a serial dater, I don’t use Rogaine, etc.) and I made sure it was funny because let’s face it, we all need a little humor to get through the day.

So in celebrating Match.com’s IPO filing, I thought I’d use some of the stuff I learned on their website and apply it to something more relevant for this forum, which aims to cover the area of online deal marketing and online capital formation. So without further ado, here it is.

The Top 10 reasons why I’m contemplating quitting my job to start an online dating website:

1 No need to register as a dating portal                                                            
2 No waiting for Title III crowdfunding rules                                                            
3 No more complaining from people tired of waiting for Title III crowdfunding rules                                                            
4 No SEC no-action letters that make my head hurt                                                            
5 No need to limit my prospects to accredited investors                                                            
6 No need to take “reasonable steps to verify” anything                                                            
7 No FINRA audits (or FINRA auditors)                                                            
8 No Reg D, Reg A, or other regulatory bureaucracy to deal with                                                            
9 No need to worry about general solicitation (but I still do have to worry about “solicitation”)                                                            
10 No need to have a “substantial pre-existing relationship"                                                        

Enjoy your weekend (and keep your sense of humor).  Steven
