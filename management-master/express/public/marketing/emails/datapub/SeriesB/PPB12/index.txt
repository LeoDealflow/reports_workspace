Got Dealflow?

I’m going to veer from my regular script this week. Instead of writing about trends in online capital formation, I’m focusing on Dealflow.

Why the focus on Dealflow? Well for starters, we’re only a few days away from the launch of our website. So it seems like a good time to reflect on how (and why) we started the company.

In 2008, our predecessor company DealFlow Media acquired a deal-tracking business called PrivateRaise. DealFlow Media was a research shop with coverage of various investment strategies. With the PrivateRaise acquisition, we put ourselves in the business of collecting deep information on private placement transactions and immediately we saw the power of data. As the 2008 financial crisis worsened into 2009 and 2010, and our Wall Street clients began slashing budgets, editorial content became harder to sell but demand for our PrivateRaise database remained strong. This was a defining moment in our company’s history.  We realized the future of our business would depend on data.

We began concentrating our efforts on PrivateRaise and scaling back editorial products that were stagnating. Then in 2011, FINRA implemented new rules allowing social communication on stocks and investment products.  All of a sudden, companies raising capital started promoting their deals on social media, in email solicitations, and eventually on online deal platforms.  When President Obama signed the JOBS Act into law in 2012, it opened the door to mainstream advertising of deals through changes to decades old rules on general solicitation. And for us, the light bulb really went off.

Since we knew the deal tracking business through PrivateRaise, we began to experiment with the collection of “actively marketed” deal data, or deals that were being pitched to investors (as opposed to deals that had already been funded).  We believed these regulatory changes would be so transformative that we decided to trade our entire business to pursue this new idea of tracking companies who were in the process of raising capital. So we sold DealFlow Media’s legacy assets to TheStreet, and in 2013, Dealflow.com was born.

My closest friends have heard me describe the Dealflow project as “inspiring.”  I’ve always fashioned myself to be a pretty good trend spotter and increasingly, my prediction over three years ago that online deal sourcing would become a critical part of capital markets is turning out to be spot-on accurate. Today, if I ask 10 people raising money if they reach beyond their personal networks and use tools like LinkedIn to find investors, do you know how many respond “Yes?”  All 10.

If you’re reading this, then you already know how quickly things are changing and how important the move toward online investing and deal sourcing is. I’d encourage you to log into Dealflow.com with your free membership and check out what we’ve been up to. You should also attend this Tuesday’s demo webcast at 2pm ET.

I’d like to express my gratitude by saying this... There are two types of people in the world.  There are people who make things and there are people who support the people who make things. I’m fortunate to have spent the last couple of years working in an office full of people who actually make things.  And I’d like to thank them for turning what began as an inspiring project into an actual business.  Let’s kick some ass.
