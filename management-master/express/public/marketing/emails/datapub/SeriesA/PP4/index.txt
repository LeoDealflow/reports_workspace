As a member of Dealflow.com, you will receive this publication every Wednesday.

In this newsletter you’ll get information about companies actively raising capital. The deals we track include private placement offerings launched by private operating companies that are marketing their deals in the United States. Companies may be based overseas, but selling efforts must be U.S.-based for us to track the deal and for that deal to be listed in our newsletter.
