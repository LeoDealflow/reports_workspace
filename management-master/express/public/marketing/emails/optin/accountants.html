    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">Hi {{{first_name}}},</p>
    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">Dealflow.com has just launched a new user registration process, which now captures actionable accounting/auditing leads from the moment someone signs up.  Now, when a company joins Dealflow.com, they’re asked if they would like a referral to an accounting firm.</p>
    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">This new registration process is part of the Dealflow Pro Referral Network where we identify companies in the process of raising capital who are also in need of professional services.  We offer an innovative approach to targeting your prospective clients at the exact time when they’re deciding what professional services to retain.</p>
    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">As a member of the Dealflow Pro Network you’ll be sent these qualified referrals every week.  These leads come from companies who have specifically requested assistance from an accounting firm.  The information you’ll receive includes background of the company, the type/size of deal, and complete contact information so you can easily reach out to the decision-maker.</p>
    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">Participation in this network will be limited to only a handful of firms.  So if this is something you’re interested in, let me know and we can schedule a phone call.</p>
    <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px !important;">Best regards,
        <br>Stacy</p>
