THE NEW ERA OF DEAL MARKETING 
Equity Crowdfunding and the Advent of Online Deal Marketing

Dealflow's latest whitepaper discusses what crowdfunding means to you. The fact is, crowdfunding has excluded the crowd and has been limited to accredited investors only. In this white paper, we cut right to the chase and illustrate how online deal marketing can be useful to you right now.

The use of technology to pitch deals is a game changer that’s had a far-reaching impact on both investors and companies raising capital. New regulations now allow for broad solicitation of deals and traditional methods of capital formation are quickly being replaced by those that leverage social media.

What's inside this white paper…

Learn the practical differences between a Rule 506(c) and Rule 506(b) filing.
Find out how you can tap into the online deal community.
See which companies are getting traction by marketing their deals through websites and email.

Equity crowdfunding is still in its early stages. Much remains to be seen about the legal and financial implications of letting Main Street into Wall Street’s backyard, but there’s no question that crowdfunding represents another example of how technology will change the way we do things.
